# Monetization Strategy

## Business Model Overview

### Freemium Philosophy
The Galactic Conquest Idle game follows an ethical freemium model with these core principles:

1. **Everything Earnable**: All content accessible through gameplay
2. **Pay for Convenience**: Money saves time, not gates content
3. **Fair Progression**: Free players can compete meaningfully
4. **Transparent Value**: Clear what purchases provide
5. **No Pay-to-Win**: Purchases enhance experience, don't dominate
6. **Respect Players**: No manipulative mechanics or artificial walls

### Ethical Monetization Principles
- No paywalls blocking progression
- No exclusive paid content that affects gameplay
- Energy/timer systems have free alternatives
- All random elements show clear odds
- Spending limits and parental controls
- Clear purchase confirmations
- Easy refund process

### Target Audience Considerations
**Primary Spenders (Whales) - 1-2%**:
- Enthusiasts who value time over money
- Completionists wanting all content quickly
- Supporters who want to fund development
- Competitive players seeking efficiency

**Secondary Spenders (Dolphins) - 5-10%**:
- Occasional convenience purchases
- Starter pack buyers
- Special event participants
- Social spenders (gifts, group benefits)

**Tertiary Spenders (Minnows) - 10-20%**:
- One-time purchases (ad removal)
- Very occasional Entangled Matter
- Sale/discount buyers only
- Loyalty reward participants

**Free Players - 70-85%**:
- Provide community and content
- Word-of-mouth marketing
- Potential future spenders
- Ad revenue if implemented

### Competitive Positioning
Compared to market leaders:
- **Less Aggressive than Raid Shadow Legends**: No constant purchase prompts
- **More Generous than AFK Arena**: Better free progression
- **Similar to Cookie Clicker**: Optional purchases, full game free
- **Premium Feel like Hades**: Quality over exploitation

## Currency Design

### Entangled Matter System

#### Core Concept
"Entangled Matter" is quantum currency that exists in superposition - it becomes whatever currency it's "entangled" with at the moment of spending. This thematically fits the reality-warping nature of the game while providing flexible value.

#### Earning Mechanisms

**Daily Missions (Reset 24h)**:
```
Simple Click Goal: 10 EM
Generate X Resources: 10 EM
Complete 3 Events: 15 EM
Active Play 30 min: 15 EM
Daily Total: 30-50 EM
```

**Weekly Missions (Reset 7d)**:
```
Prestige Once: 100 EM
Try New Strategy: 50 EM
Reach New Stage: 150 EM
Complete All Dailies: 200 EM
Weekly Total: 200-500 EM
```

**Monthly Missions (Reset 30d)**:
```
Master a Faction: 500 EM
Reach Milestone: 750 EM
Special Challenge: 1000 EM
Login 25 Days: 1250 EM
Monthly Total: 1500-3500 EM
```

**Special Sources**:
- Achievement completion: 10-100 EM
- First time bonuses: 50-500 EM
- Event participation: 25-250 EM
- Community goals: 100-1000 EM

#### Spending Options

**Currency Entanglement**:
When spending EM, player chooses what it becomes:
- Credits: Scales with progression (1h → 24h production)
- Influence: Scales with progression (1h → 24h production)
- Dark Matter: Scales with progression (1h → 24h production)
- Energy: Special limits (3 per prestige max)

**Time Warps**:
- 2x speed (30 min): 50 EM
- 4x speed (30 min): 150 EM
- 8x speed (30 min): 400 EM
- 24h instant progress: 2000 EM

**Convenience Features**:
- Skip event cooldown: 25 EM
- Instant building: 10-100 EM (scales)
- Auto-condense early: 500 EM
- Queue system: 200 EM/slot

**Special Entanglements**:
- Faction goodwill: 1000 EM
- Instant research: 50-500 EM
- Trade route establish: 100 EM
- Wormhole creation discount: 5000 EM

#### Conversion Rates
Base rates that scale with progression:
```
Early Game (Planetary):
1 EM = 1 hour current production

Mid Game (Galactic):
1 EM = 6 hours current production

Late Game (Universal):
1 EM = 24 hours current production

End Game (Multiversal):
1 EM = 72 hours current production
```

#### Psychological Hooks
- **Flexible Value**: Players feel smart choosing when/how to spend
- **Scaling Worth**: EM becomes more valuable as they progress
- **Limited Energy**: Creates interesting decisions on Energy conversion
- **Event Bonuses**: "Quantum Flux" events with 2-5x value
- **Visual Feedback**: Quantum particle effects when spending
