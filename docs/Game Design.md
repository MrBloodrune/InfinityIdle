## Core Systems

### Currency System

The game features a 4-tier currency hierarchy with condensation mechanics that create natural progression gates and meaningful milestones.

#### Base Currencies
1. **Credits** 
   - Primary resource for buildings and basic upgrades
   - Generated by: Clicking, basic buildings, events
   - Condensation: 1,000,000 Credits → 1 Influence
   - Sinks: Buildings, units, infrastructure

2. **Influence**
   - Political/diplomatic currency
   - Generated by: Specialized buildings, events, credit condensation
   - Condensation: 1,000,000 Influence → 1 Dark Matter
   - Sinks: Travel costs, diplomacy, faction relations, trade routes

3. **Dark Matter**
   - Advanced technology and late-game currency
   - Generated by: Advanced buildings, influence condensation, cosmic events
   - Cannot be condensed further (reality limit)
   - Sinks: High-tier buildings, advanced research, warp travel

4. **Energy** (Prestige Currency)
   - Reality-warping meta currency
   - Generated by: Sacrificing planets/systems/galaxies
   - Cannot be generated passively
   - Uses: Faction switching, reality warps, permanent upgrades
   - See [[Mathematical Systems#Energy Formulas]] for calculation details

#### Currency Condensation Mechanics
- **Manual Process** with confirmation dialog to prevent accidents
- **Base Ratio**: 1,000,000:1 for each tier
- **Efficiency Upgrades**: Can improve to 900k:1, 800k:1, down to 500k:1
- **Faction Bonuses**: 
  - Machine Intelligence: Perfect 1:1 ratio
  - Technocratic Union: -30% better ratios
  - Other factions: Various smaller bonuses
- **Automation**: Unlocks at prestige level 10
- Creates natural progression gates - can't access Dark Matter buildings until generating millions of Influence

#### Primary Click Action
**Imperial Decree** - The emperor's will made manifest
- Generates small amounts of all three base currencies  
- Base values scale with progression stage
- Modified by faction choice and upgrades
- Can trigger instant events or temporary bonuses
- See [[Code Examples#Click Calculation]] for implementation

- Tier 4 (1000+ Energy): Complete faction memory, fundamental constant changes, omnipotence mode
- See [[Content Database#Reality Warp List]] for full options

### Faction System

The faction system provides six unique playstyles, each encouraging different strategies and multiple playthroughs.

#### Multi-Axis Philosophy System
Based on four philosophical axes that determine faction compatibility:
- **Expansion Axis**: Isolationist ↔ Expansionist
- **Governance Axis**: Authoritarian ↔ Democratic  
- **Technology Axis**: Traditionalist ↔ Progressive
- **Economic Axis**: Collectivist ↔ Individualist

#### Faction Overview

   - Bonuses: x2 fleet production, -20% travel costs
   - Penalties: x0.5 influence generation
   - Unique Mechanic: Can declare war for resource bonuses
   - Energy Focus: Converting conquered worlds

2. **Merchant Republic** (Expansionist/Individualist)
   - Bonuses: x3 credit generation, -50% trade route costs
   - Penalties: x0.7 dark matter generation
   - Unique Mechanic: Trade routes generate increasing returns
   - Energy Focus: Bankrupting then consuming economic rivals

3. **Technocratic Union** (Progressive/Collectivist)
   - Bonuses: x1.5 automation, -30% condensation ratios
   - Penalties: x0.8 click power
   - Unique Mechanic: Research provides permanent multipliers

   - Energy Focus: Devouring entire biospheres

See [[Content Database#Faction Details]] for complete information on each faction.

#### Faction Switching
- Requires Energy investment (scales with current power level)
- Retains 10-50% of buildings based on faction compatibility
- Unlocks cross-faction technologies after switching
- Each faction has exclusive achievements and unlocks
- Switching strategy is key to late-game optimization

### Travel & Expansion System

The travel system adds a spatial strategy layer that makes expansion decisions meaningful rather than automatic.

#### Distance-Based Costs

**Early Game (Planetary/Solar)**:
- Intra-system travel: Free
- Nearby planets: Credit cost only (100 * distance)
- System edge: Minor Influence cost (10 * distance^1.5)

**Mid Game (Galactic)**:
- Adjacent systems: Influence cost (100 * distance^2)
- Trade route establishment: Influence upkeep (10/minute/jump)
- Warp jumps: Dark Matter cost for instant travel (100 * distance)
- Exploration missions: Time + resource investment

**Late Game (Universal)**:
- Galaxy hopping: Dark Matter + Energy cost
- Wormhole creation: Energy investment for permanent shortcuts (100 Energy)
- Reality bridges: Connect any two locations (1000 Energy)

#### Travel Modifiers
- **Faction Bonuses**: 
  - Merchants: -50% trade route costs
  - Military: -20% all travel costs  
  - Psionic: Free intra-galaxy travel
  - Organic Hive: +50% travel costs
- **Technology**: Warp efficiency -10% per level (max -50%)
- **Infrastructure**: Space highways reduce adjacent costs by 25%
- **Diplomacy**: Allied systems -75% travel cost

#### Strategic Implications
- Expansion vs consolidation decisions
- Distant high-value targets become risk/reward choices
- Natural progression gates without hard locks
- Infrastructure investment becomes meaningful
- Trade route optimization creates economic sub-game

### Event System

The event system provides dynamic challenges and opportunities that break up the core loop and create emergent narratives.

#### Progressive Complexity
Events become more complex as players progress, training them for deeper mechanics:
- **Early Game**: 80% binary choices, 20% resource-based
- **Mid Game**: 50% binary, 50% multi-option
- **Late Game**: 20% binary, 80% complex strategic decisions

#### Event Categories

**Political** (25% of events)
- Binary: "Support coup?" Yes (+military, -influence) / No (+influence, -military)
- Complex: Multiple faction support options with cascading consequences
- Examples: Elections, succession crises, diplomatic incidents

**Economic** (25% of events)
- Binary: "Exploit workers?" Yes (+credits now) / No (+credits/second)
- Complex: Market manipulation with risk/reward ratios
- Examples: Market crashes, resource discoveries, trade disputes

**Military** (25% of events)
- Binary: "Crush rebellion?" Yes (lose population) / No (lose control)
- Complex: Multiple military strategies with resource costs
- Examples: Invasions, rebellions, pirate attacks

**Cosmic** (25% of events)
- Binary: "Investigate anomaly?" Yes (random effect) / No (safe)
- Complex: Research paths with permanent consequences
- Examples: Wormholes, ancient artifacts, space phenomena

#### Event Frequency
- Early game: 1 event per 5-10 minutes
- Mid game: 1 event per 2-5 minutes
- Late game: Multiple simultaneous events requiring prioritization
- Faction choice affects both frequency and type distribution

#### Future: Mini-game Events
Planned for post-launch to add active gameplay moments:
- **Siege Events**: Rapid clicking for success chance
- **Diplomacy Events**: Pattern matching for better outcomes  
- **Research Events**: Simple puzzles for permanent bonuses
- Success grants small permanent multipliers (0.1% - 1%)

See [[Content Database#Event Templates]] for complete event list.

## Design Validation Questions

### Core Loop Concerns
1. Is 15% cost growth too aggressive for buildings with travel costs added?
2. Does the 1M:1 condensation ratio feel achievable and rewarding?
3. Is the click action meaningful throughout progression?
4. Do the four currencies feel distinct and valuable?

### Balance Considerations  
1. Are faction bonuses/penalties creating interesting tradeoffs?
2. Does Energy gain rate support 2-4 hour first prestige?
3. Are travel costs strategic or just annoying?
4. Is late-game progression satisfying or too grindy?

### Player Psychology
1. Are there enough "wow" moments in progression?
2. Does faction switching feel rewarding vs punishing?
3. Are events enhancing or interrupting flow?
4. Is the complexity curve too steep?

### Competitive Analysis
1. How do we differentiate from Cookie Clicker's simplicity?
2. What depth elements from Realm Grinder should we adopt?
3. Are we too complex compared to Adventure Capitalist?
4. What can we learn from Universal Paperclips' narrative?

### Future Considerations
1. Should Entangled Matter → Energy conversion be limited?
2. Is the faction system expandable for DLC?
3. Can the travel system support PvP raids later?
4. How do we keep endgame fresh after 1000+ hours?
