# Development Plan

## Project Overview

### Scope and Constraints
- **Project Name**: Galactic Conquest Idle (Working Title)
- **Development Timeline**: 20 weeks to MVP, 6 months to full release
- **Budget Constraints**: Indie-scale, self-funded initially
- **Platform Priority**: PC first, mobile within 3 months
- **Team Size**: 3-5 developers initially

### Team Structure Needs

#### Core Team (Minimum Viable)
1. **Lead Developer/Designer** - Systems and gameplay
2. **UI/UX Developer** - Interface and user experience  
3. **Backend Developer** - Save systems, analytics, multiplayer

#### Extended Team (Ideal)
4. **Artist** - Icons, backgrounds, effects
5. **QA Tester** - Balance and bug testing
6. **Community Manager** - Player feedback and marketing
7. **Sound Designer** - SFX and ambient music (contract)

### Technology Stack
- **Engine**: Unity 2021.3 LTS (2D)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **Project Management**: Trello/Jira
- **Analytics**: Unity Analytics + Custom
- **Backend**: PlayFab or custom Node.js
- **Monetization**: Unity IAP
- **Math Library**: BreakInfinity.cs

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks
- Save system corruption → Implement rolling backups
- Number overflow → Use BreakInfinity from day 1
- Performance degradation → Profile every build
- Cross-platform issues → Test early and often

#### Design Risks  
- Complexity creep → Start simple, iterate based on data
- Balance issues → Implement analytics from day 1
- Tutorial drop-off → Test first 10 minutes extensively
- Faction imbalance → Beta test each faction thoroughly

#### Business Risks
- Market saturation → Focus on unique faction system
- Monetization rejection → Keep all content earnable
- Platform policies → Review guidelines regularly
- Competition from AAA → Emphasize indie charm
